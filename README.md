# Descriprion
"
Mastermind is a code-breaking game where the player attempts to guess a secret code composed of four digits.
The generateSecretCode() ensures a unique and random secret code for each game session.
The isFour() checks if the provided string has exactly four characters.
The places() compares the secret code with the player's guess to determine how well-placed and misplaced pieces should be counted.
The check() prompts the user to enter guesses, validates the input, checks the guesses against the secret code, and provides feedback. The function continues until the player either guesses the correct code or reaches the specified number of rounds.
The all() serves as the entry point for the program.
